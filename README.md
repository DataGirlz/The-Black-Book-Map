# Black Book Map 🌍📚

I created the Black Book Map after realizing that The Three Musketeers was written by a Black author and that pirates both freed and enslaved people across the globe. Growing up, I learned about my ancestors and their power, but it wasn’t until I explored books that I truly saw their ingenuity and creativity.

The Black Book Map is my way of sharing that discovery. It’s a tool for readers, young people, and anyone curious about Black narratives worldwide. You can locate Black writers and allies across continents, uncover stories that resonate with you, and explore histories and perspectives often missing from mainstream narratives.

This project makes Black literature accessible, discoverable, and deeply personal. Whether you’re seeking inspiration, education, or simply a new story to dive into, the Black Book Map guides you to a world waiting to be explored.
